Two Optimization Problems: A Transshipment Problem and A Risk Minimizing Problem

This repo presents a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of optimization methodologies applied to two
distinct, real-world problems.
- The first part of the project focuses on the Rockhill Shipping & Transport Company's logistics problem
involving hazardous waste transportation and transshipment. Linear programming techniques will be employed to
optimize shipping routes and minimize costs.
- The second part tackles the challenge of investment allocation in a
diverse portfolio, using quadratic programming techniques to derive optimal investment allocations while
minimizing risk.
